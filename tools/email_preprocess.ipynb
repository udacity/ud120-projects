this associ and are we go to send someon to the meet regular do we have ani brochur or other inform regard the makeup of the associ from my convers with mark taylor i do not think that isda has ani plan to implement a spanish languag isda master the translat process of the master the schedul and all of the various definit book would be a serious undertak there are liter hundr of page of document that would have to be legal translat and most us compani that make a market in deriv product would not have the legal and backoffic personnel to negoti and process master and transact in spanish i know that ena doe not have the capac to do this at the moment i think the onli other languag isda is publish in is japanes and that is a restrict format use onli between two japanes compani for a limit number of type of trade specif to the japanes market english will like remain the languag of choic in intern transact such as what we are do now between ena and argentin counterparti if the tax

transact is take place if the isda was at least written in spanish rather than french or german it would be of great help this is an issu that realli tickl me whi isnt the isda document translat into

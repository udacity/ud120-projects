Identify Fraud from Enron Email - Starter Code for Python 3.8 
==============

Udacity decided this project won't be upgraded to Python 3.
This was not a deal breaker since using Anaconda one can have multiple environments running on the same computer.

Unfortunately, Apple latest OS (Big Sur) breaks Python 2 on Anaconda and since Python 2 is deprecated there won't be a fix for this.

I decided to migrate the project myself and include an Anaconda Environment file, I consider the environment should have been part of the course from the start.

## Creating an Environment

You can create an environment using anaconda:

```
$ conda env create environments/python-3.8.yaml

$ conda activate py38

```


## Offered As-Is
I offer no guarantees that will work or will be accepted by reviewers.
